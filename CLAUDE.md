# CLAUDE.md — intelbit-river-connector-ozon

## Контекст

Публичный коннектор Ozon Seller API для Интелбит:Река.
Целевой сценарий: маркетплейс↔1С (FBS-заказы, остатки, цены, вебхуки).
Паспорт проекта в Obsidian: `4-17 Интелбит Река/`.

## Связь с monorepo

`intelbit-river-sdk` — в `~/Developer/intelbit-river-monorepo/packages/sdk/`.
Импортируем как path-dependency в pyproject.toml.

## Workflow

Промпты — в Obsidian `4-17 Интелбит Река/04 Промпты для Claude Code/`.
После работы — статус в `Статус разработки.md`.

**Не push'у автоматически** — жду команды «push» от Свята.

## Линт и тесты перед коммитом

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
```

## LLM Coding Guidelines (Karpathy)

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
